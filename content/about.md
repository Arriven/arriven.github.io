## Hi there

My name is Bohdan Ivashko and I'm a distibuted systems engineer ~~by day, shitposter by night~~, ex. gamedev.

My professional interests include but not limited to:

- rust/go/c++ (in the applied order)
- distributed systems (no way)
- network engineering and protocols
- database/OS/hardware internals
- systems engineering in general
- system design
- CI/CD and operations
- cybersecurity
- gamedev (no way (2), mostly technical stuff)

You can expect this site to eventually contain various content related to the topics described above (no promises thought, I'm rather lazy :upside_down_face:)
